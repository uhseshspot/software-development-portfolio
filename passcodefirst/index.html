        I need to also add a security barrier so that my code is hidden 
        and my website is protected.

            To mitigate this risk, it's recommended to use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) 
            to encrypt the transmission and protect the password in 
            transit. Additionally, you should always hash and store 
            passwords securely on the server-side to prevent unauthorized 
            access. 
            
            Okay so try and add this in.
